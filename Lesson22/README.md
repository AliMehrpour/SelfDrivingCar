# Computer Vision 

In this lesson I've used Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees and some computer vision techniques for detecting and tracking vehicles.
* Color Features
* Template Matching
* Color Histogram Matching
* Color Spaces
* Spatial Binning of Color
* Histogram Of Gradient Feature
* Heatmap
* Multiple Detectiona and False Positive
* Tracking Vehicle
